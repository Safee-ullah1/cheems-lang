# Cheems-Lang


### Description

Welcome to `Cheems-Lang`! This is my first project using the Rust programming language and it's a programming language inspired by the humorous Cheems meme. It's a unique way of combining two things I love: the power and speed of Rust, and the quirky style of the Cheems meme.

### Why Cheems-Lang?

`Cheems-Lang` aims to put a fun twist on programming, merging the iconic 'bork' dialect of Cheems with the precision and safety of Rust. As my first project in Rust, `Cheems-Lang` is a testament to my learning journey and the exploration of Rust's key features such as zero-cost abstractions, ownership, and fearless concurrency.

### Journey in Rust

Learning Rust has been a rewarding process and `Cheems-Lang` serves as a living testament to my progress. It's a tribute to the nuances of Rust that I've discovered along the way and my commitment to master this performance-oriented language.

### Getting Started

Inside this repository, you'll find the initial code base, which will be updated as my proficiency in Rust improves and the language evolves.
